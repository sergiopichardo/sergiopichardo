## Hi, I'm Sergio üëã. I'm a full-stack software engineer who's passionate about solving problems with code.

Currently, I'm excited to be part of the team at Immigrant Buddies, where we're building a platform that connects immigrants with volunteers (buddies) to help them adjust to life in the USA. My role at Immigrant Buddies primarily involves backend development using AWS serverless technologies.

Previously, I had the pleasure of collaborating with an amazing remote team of 4 developers on a cloud infrastructure-based, open-source application called Armada. Armada was created to solve the problem many computer science teachers face: configuration overload and dependency management. Armada, makes it easy to configure and deploy development environments to the cloud at scale using Docker and Amazon Web Services. You can read our case study here: https://team-armada.github.io/case-study.html

Some of my technical skills include: 
- Frontend: React, Next.js, Zustand, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, Radix-UI Primitives
- Backend: Node.js/TypeScript, Python, Go, PostgreSQL, MongoDB. 
- Infrastructure: AWS CDK, Terraform, IAM, S3, CloudFront, Lambda, AppSync, API Gateway, DynamoDB, RDS
- Tooling: Jira, Confluence, Git, GitHub, jest-cucumber, Cypress, Playwright, technical diagramming, Bash, Linux

Whether it's coding, problem-solving, or just geeking out over the latest tech trends, I'm always up for a good conversation.

Let's connect, chat, or explore how we can collaborate!
