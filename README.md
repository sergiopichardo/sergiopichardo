## Hi, I'm Sergio üëã. I'm a full-stack software engineer who's passionate about solving problems with code.

Currently, I'm thrilled to be part of the team at Last Call Media, where I work on cloud-based solutions, leveraging tools like Terraform and Amazon ECS to build scalable and reliable infrastructure. 

Previously, I worked on an innovative platform called Immigrant Buddies, which connects immigrants with volunteers to help them adjust to life in the USA. My focus was on backend development using AWS serverless technologies, enabling a scalable and cost-efficient foundation.

I also collaborated with a remote team of developers on Armada, an open-source application designed to simplify the configuration and deployment of development environments for computer science educators. You can learn more about this project in our case study: Armada Case Study.

Some of my technical skills include:

- Frontend: React, Next.js, Zustand, TailwindCSS, ShadCN, Radix-UI Primitives
- Backend: Node.js/TypeScript, Python, Go, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Infrastructure: AWS CDK, Terraform, ECS, IAM, S3, CloudFront, Lambda, AppSync, API Gateway, DynamoDB, RDS
- Tooling: Jira, Confluence, Git, GitHub, jest-cucumber, Cypress, Playwright, technical diagramming, Bash, Linux

Whether it's coding, problem-solving, or geeking out over the latest tech trends, I'm always up for a great conversation.

Let's connect, chat, or explore how we can collaborate!
