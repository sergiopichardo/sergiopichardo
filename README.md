## Hi there, I'm Sergio! 👋
### I'm a software engineer based in Starkville, Mississippi. 🗺️

I have several years of experience in JavaScript, TypeScript and a variety of frameworks. I have extensive experience with AWS and hold 2 associate-level certifications. 

I'm also a co-creator of ✨ [Armada](https://team-armada.github.io/) ✨, an open-source application to configure and deploy containerized development environments. 

We built Armada using the following technologies: TypeScript, PostgreSQL, VPC, EC2, ELB, ECS, EFC, Cognito, Lambda and the AWS Cloud Development Kit.
